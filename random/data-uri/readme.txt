This is a sample of implementing an own Asynchronous Pluggable
Protocol Handler. The source is for reference. The precompiled
DLL is fully working data: protocol handler for IE4+ on Windows 95
or newer. Interaction with IE versions that have data: protocol
built-in is not tested. IE also imposes length limits on URLs, so
some inline-data might not work.
