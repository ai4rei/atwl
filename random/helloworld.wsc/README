====================================================================

This is an illustration of how the helloworld COM component could
be implemented as Windows Scripting Component, which is basically
an interpreted COM component hosted by a COM DLL.
This is experimental code, use it at YOUR OWN RISK.

If you use this as framework for your own component, do not forget
to change CLSID and ProgID.

wz10en.exe is the Microsoft* Windows* Script Component Wizard. It
generates the base .wsc file. Since it ceased being available from
microsoft and it's hard to find in the web archives, I'm mirroring
it here. It requires a quick installation, since it's implmented as
a COM component itself.
