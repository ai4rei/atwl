====================================================================

This is bare minimum needed to create a shell namespace extension
without ATL. This is experimental code, use it at YOUR OWN RISK. In
the install script replace <<path>> with the actual path to the DLL.

If you use this as framework for your own component, do not forget
to change CLSID.
