====================================================================

This is bare minimum needed to create an COM component, callable
from scripts (VBScript etc.) without ATL. This is experimental code,
use it at YOUR OWN RISK. In the install script replace <<path>> with
the actual path to the DLL.

If you use this as framework for your own component, do not forget
to change CLSID, IID and ProgID.
