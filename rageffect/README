About:

    This is a RagnarokOnline* Client Plug-In that allows visual
    effect definitions to be edited within a convenient text table
    as opposed to hard-coded values in the client. Provided template
    reflects the hard-coded values of the indicated client.

Usage:

    Place id2rageffect.txt into the data\ folder in the
    RagnarokOnline directory and rageffect.asi in the RagnarokOnline
    directory. The client will load the Plug-In upon next start.

Customization:

    See notes in id2rageffect.txt on the format of the data. The
    Plug-In output can be observed with DebugView from Sysinternals.
