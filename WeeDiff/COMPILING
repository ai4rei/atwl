Makefile (primary)
    Requires Visual C++ 2010 or newer Command Line. Use `nmake' to
    run it.

WeeToolsExpress.sln (updated occasionally)
    Requires Visual C++ 2010 (any edition).

WeeTools.sln (obsolete)
    Requires Visual Studio 2010 with Visual C++. Will not open
    with Express Edition due to solution folders.

NOTE: All components must be built with the same compiler, due to
      the way the plugin system is designed. Doing otherwise can
      lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
