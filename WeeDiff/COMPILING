build.bat (primary)
    Requires Visual C++ 2010 Command Line (any edition). Run it from
    the directory it resides in. Any Express Edition short-commings
    are fixed ad-hoc.

WeeToolsExpress.sln (updated occasionally)
    Requires Visual C++ 2010 (any edition). Express Editions will
    need rigged-in afxres.h for compiling resources.

WeeTools.sln (obsolete)
    Requires Visual Studio 2010 with Visual C++. Will not open
    with Express Edition due to solution folders.

NOTE: All components must be built with the same compiler, due to
      the way the plugin system is designed. Doing otherwise can
      lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
