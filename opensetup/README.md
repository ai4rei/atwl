# OpenSetup
This is the last version of RO OpenSetup before it went closed-source due to absence of a closed feedback loop and the additional cost of maintaining open-source software (i.e. limits usage of closed-source components) with no added benefit. It remains there for archaeological research.

## Known issues
* [aavc] This tool may not be safe for computers running Avast Anti-Virus.
* 64-bit builds do not work
