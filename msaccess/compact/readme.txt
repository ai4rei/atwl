This applies the Microsoft Access command "Compact and Repair" to a
database of choice from command line. Does not require to have
Office or Access Runtime installed, only requirement is DAO, which
is generally available on all 32-bit Windows versions. 64-bit
version may need some registry tweaking to make it work. The return
value is 0 if the database was successfully compacted, 1 otherwise.

This primarily serves as sample code for using DAO from C++ using
Visual C++ smart pointers and as a command line utility for batch
usage.

Released into public domain.
